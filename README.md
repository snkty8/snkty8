### Welcome!! &nbsp; ![](https://visitor-badge.glitch.me/badge?page_id=snkty8.snkty8)

I have recently completed a Data Anlaytics and Visualization Bootcamp assoicated with the University of Central Florida.  It was an awesome experince!! I was able to learn Python, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Tableau, MYSQL, SQLite, APIs, Web-Scrapping, R, AWS, and Machine Learning.  It was an intense 24 week course, and I am happy I was able to complete it!! I'm looking for to the next, and that's finding a place for myself in the world of Data Science <img src="https://media3.giphy.com/media/QBSPma5jP9ReSAdxKw/giphy.gif" width="25px">
